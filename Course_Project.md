# Course Project

During the course, students are required to complete a project that accomplishes a non-trivial programming / data processing task using Python tools.

## Possible project topics:

-   Process, analyze, and/or visualize a dataset.
-   Small game
-   Web site
-   Web scraping project
-   other
-   ML project
-   some shell automation (getting things done with Python!) script

Data sets can come from a variety of sources, such as kaggle.com, data.gov.lv, or faculty.

All processing and visualization will have to be done in the Python programming language with the appropriate Pyhon libraries.

You can use libraries covered in the course or/and from outside the course.

Other topics may also be selected with prior agreement with the faculty.

Projects can be submitted in teams of 2-3 people.

## Project Description Presentation

In November students should present project description in class.

-   The idea
-   Rough idea on libraries/tools needed
-   What a successful outcome should be

## Final Project Presentation

Project presentation January 2021 or possible before Xmas break 2020.

Project presentation = 5-10 min. presentation consisting of:

-   Introduction (what the work is about)
-   Project realization (what was programmed, what software was used)
-   Demonstrations of results

You have to show what the project has done in practice = show code and results.

-   job description (including list of group members)
-   Developed source code (or its URL at Github,Gitlab etc)
-   Job results (eg Jupyter notebook, screenshots, text results)
